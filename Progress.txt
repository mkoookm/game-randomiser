We are making a game randomizer for a variety of situations. It will store game, player, and group data in files inside of the project's directory to store all of the information. On startup, the program should load all of the files in automatically. The user can make a new game, player, and group through the GUI. Then, the user will be able to randomly select a game owned by a person in a specified group depending on specifeied criteria. The planned criteria are whether the games are online, minimum and maximum players, and whether you want to play round robin style, passing controllers between all of the players.

So far we have made classes to store information of the games, players, and groups. The player and group classes have file functionality to create and write to a file, or read one when the class is initialized.
